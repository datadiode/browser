Endorphin is a cross platform web browser built using Qt and WebKit.

This is a fork of the [Endorphin browser](https://github.com/EndorphinBrowser/browser),
which Aaron Dewes created as a fork of the [Arora browser](https://github.com/Arora/arora).

## WARNING
This project does not deliver a secure browser which is safe for browsing the internet.  
Know your responsibilities when deploying to production.

### Building
Endorphin uses the cmake build system.  If you already have Qt 5.14 or newer on your system building is as easy as running the command 'cmake' and then 'make'.
For more detailed information see the [Building guide](BUILDING.md).
